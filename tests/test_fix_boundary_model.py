"""Regression tests for the boundary/model fixes.

F1 — kg_write must not silently erase failure memory (§1.7). A span-present/inferred edge whose EXACT
canonical identity already lives in FAILURE_STATES (failed/rejected) must be QUARANTINED on re-emit,
never deduped + accepted (which the canon merge would then write back as a fresh `unverified` edge,
overwriting the refutation). The collapse on the NON-hypothesized lane checks the same `ident` ONLY —
the reverse edge has its own honest textual support and is a distinct claim, so it stays accepted.

F33 — slug() docstring softening only; no behavior change. A focused assertion pins the real (weaker)
guarantee the docstring now states, so the doc can't drift back to overclaiming.
