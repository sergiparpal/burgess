"""Regression tests for the two review nits deferred from the first fix pass and completed here:

- F29 (reconciler-6): scan() builds its live file/key sets INCREMENTALLY instead of a second full
  all_nodes() re-parse per sweep. These tests pin the safety-critical property that the incremental
  live_keys is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the old all_nodes()-derived set, so pruning of the §1.8 forged-verdict
  baseline is unchanged — plus a spy proving the second full read is actually gone, and a legacy-state
  backfill case.
- F37: a read-only consumer (the precontext PreToolUse hook, fired on every Grep/Glob/Read) can
  construct Canon(..., ensure_layout=False) WITHOUT the constructor side effects (canon-dir mkdir +
  .git/info/exclude rewrite), while the default stays eager. Since 0.4.2 the MCP server and the
  per-session reconcile are lazy too, and the layout is created by the first write
  (tests/test_fix_session_start.py).
