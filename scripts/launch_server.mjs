// MCP server launcher + SUPERVISOR (cross-platform; §2.1 bootstrap hardening + transport-resilience pass).
//
// `.mcp.json` runs `node launch_server.mjs`. Two jobs:
//
// 1. COLD-START SELF-HEAL (the original role). Launching the server directly as `<venv>/bin/python`
//    races the SessionStart venv build: on a cold first session that path may not exist yet, the spawn
//    fails, and Claude Code caches the server as "needs-auth" — dropping all kg_* tools for the whole
//    session. Going through Node (always present) means the MCP spawn ALWAYS succeeds; this launcher
//    then makes sure a venv build is under way and waits for it before launching the real server.
//    Warm sessions skip straight to launch.
//
//    The build never runs in THIS process (0.4.3). Claude Code gives a server MCP_TIMEOUT ms (30 000
//    by default) to answer `initialize`, then abandons it and kills it, and on Windows the processes it
//    started directly die with it (Node's and the `py` launcher's job objects). The launcher used to run
//    the build itself, in the foreground, and a cold Windows build takes minutes, so the kill landed
//    mid-install: a provision lock held by a dead pid, a half-built venv, and still no engine for the
//    session. Now the build goes to bootstrap's DETACHED worker (`--background`), which that kill does
//    not reach (checked with `taskkill /F /T` mid-wait), and the launcher only waits — while an engine
//    launched at the end of the wait could still answer in time (CONNECT). If the venv is not ready by
//    then, it says so and exits; the build carries on, and the user reconnects from /mcp once it is done
//    (Claude Code never retries a failed stdio server by itself).
//
// 2. SUPERVISION (the resilience pass). The Node process is a PERSISTENT PARENT that spawns the Python
//    engine as a child and supervises it, with capped exponential backoff, a crash-loop guard, and full
//    logging of every (re)launch / exit / backoff decision to `<KG_DATA>/server.log` (the SAME rotating
//    file the engine writes — see server.py:configure_logging). The restart POLICY is the pure, exported
//    `restartDecision` / `backoffFor`, unit-testable without spawning a real engine.
//
//    What it relaunches — and why NOT everything. The engine runs with `stdio: "inherit"`, so Node never
//    owns the JSON-RPC stream and CANNOT replay MCP's per-connection `initialize` handshake. That splits
//    a crash into two cases (see restartDecision for the full reasoning):
//      • STARTUP failure (crash before the engine served `initialize`, e.g. an import error against a
//        half-built venv): the client's `initialize` is still buffered, unread, on the inherited stdin, so
//        a heal + in-place relaunch genuinely self-heals the cold-start race — and the parent (hence the
//        client pipe) stays alive. This is the original §2.1 role, now with backoff + a crash-loop cap.
//      • POST-INIT crash (the engine had already answered `initialize`): a relaunched engine would start
//        UNINITIALIZED on a pipe the client already handshaked, and — because Node holds the pipe open —
//        the client neither re-handshakes nor sees an EOF, i.e. a connection that looks alive but is dead.
//        That is strictly WORSE than a clean disconnect, so we EXIT instead: the pipe closes, the client
//        detects the drop and reconnects with a fresh handshake. (Fully transparent post-init restart
//        would require Node to PROXY the stream and replay the handshake + synthesize responses for
//        in-flight request ids — a larger change, deliberately deferred.)
//    Either way the failure is now LOGGED with a full traceback (server.log) instead of vanishing.
//
// Venv/interpreter resolution lives in ./_engine_resolve.mjs (shared with the other launchers).

// CRITICAL design point (why post-init crashes EXIT rather than relaunch). The engine runs with

// `initialize` handshake on a relaunch. That makes the two cases fundamentally different:
//   • A crash DURING STARTUP (before the engine served `initialize`) leaves the client's `initialize`
//     request still BUFFERED, unread, on the inherited stdin — a relaunched engine reads and answers it,
//     so an in-place heal/relaunch genuinely self-heals the cold-start race (§2.1, the original role).
//   • A crash AFTER the engine already answered `initialize` cannot be papered over: a relaunched engine
//     starts uninitialized, the client (seeing Node still alive) never re-handshakes AND gets no EOF, so
//     the connection looks alive but is dead — strictly WORSE than a clean disconnect. So we EXIT: Node
//     goes away, the pipe closes, the client detects the drop and reconnects with a fresh handshake.
// `servedInit` is the AUTHORITATIVE signal: the engine writes a readiness marker as its serve loop comes
// up (server.readiness_lifespan), so a crash with the marker present is post-init regardless of how long
// it ran — this is what fixes a fast post-init crash (a tool call that kills the engine in <5s) being
// mis-relaunched in place and stranding the client. `EARLY_FAILURE_MS` remains the FALLBACK proxy used
// only when the marker is absent (an older engine, or the marker write failed): the engine's
// import+startup is sub-second, so a crash within the window is overwhelmingly a startup failure. (Fully
