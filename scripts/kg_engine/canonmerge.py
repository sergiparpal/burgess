"""Semantic git merge driver for the per-node canon (§1.2/§1.4) — the safe half of R5.

A canon note is YAML frontmatter (the three axes + an ``edges:`` block) plus free body text. When two
branches/machines edit the *same* node, a line-based merge mangles the `edges:` list and — worse — can
silently keep one side's grounding verdict. This driver mirrors the **edge-union + base-aware-verdict**
intent of ``Canon._merge_into_existing`` (canon.py) — NOT its exact resolution logic: it unions edges by
the deterministic ``edge_id`` (model.edge_id) and, for an edge present on both sides at a **different**
``epistemic_state``, resolves it with a **base-aware 3-way** (like the scalar frontmatter below): when
only ONE side changed the state from the merge base (git's %O), that side's verdict is kept (with
``verdict_by``/``verdict_at``/span) — a one-sided, locally-audited grounding or §1.7 failure must survive
a routine same-note merge, not be silently destroyed. Only a genuine **two-sided** conflict (both sides
diverged from base, or no base at all) demotes to ``unverified`` with the verdict fields cleared (the
demotion the reconciler applies to an out-of-band verdict change, §1.8). ``_merge_into_existing`` is
instead asymmetric incoming-wins with a re-promote special-case — each is safe only in its own context.
This driver ADDS beyond ``_merge_into_existing``: the base-aware node-level verdict resolution and a
scalar-frontmatter 3-way.

Forge-safety does NOT rely on always writing ``unverified``: a one-sided verdict this driver keeps has,
on any machine that did not author it, no matching audit record, so the reconciler's full audit-aware
sweep re-quarantines it — exactly as it already does for a verdict that survives a clean (non-conflicting)
merge. So the driver preserves a legitimate one-sided verdict without ever letting a forged one stand, and
the deferred cross-machine verdict-sharing half remains unnecessary for safety here (see CHANGELOG).

Wired as a git merge driver via ``.gitattributes`` (``canon/*.md merge=kgcanon``) plus a one-time
``git config merge.kgcanon.driver`` pointing at ``scripts/canon_merge_driver.mjs`` (which runs this
module's ``main`` through the resolved engine python). See README / CLAUDE.md for the install steps.

Pure stdlib + the model layer + the atomicio leaf (shared crash-safe write); no network, no canon
I/O, no audit log.
