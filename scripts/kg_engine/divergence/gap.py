"""Advisory surface/mechanism gap measurement.

The engine embeds two views of each idea: the full idea text (SURFACE) and the open /
``primary_novelty`` axis value, typically ``mechanism`` (MECHANISM). A slate can be spread
in surface space (varied wording) yet clustered in mechanism space (the same approach
reworded) — surface diversity then OVERSTATES approach diversity. This module measures that
gap. Pure measurement: advisory only, never a gate, and never fed into selection geometry
(the DPP ``q``).
