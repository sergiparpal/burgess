"""Anti-collapse monitor.

Two complementary signals decide whether the search is converging:

* **Shannon entropy over niche occupancy** — are ideas spreading across many
  niches, or piling into a few? Low normalized entropy == collapse.
* **Mean pairwise cosine** of the current generation — are the raw candidates
  getting samey? The similarity signal is **calibrated to the project**: a
  rolling baseline of recent generations' mean cosine is kept, and a generation
  trips the flag when it is meaningfully *more* similar than that baseline
  (``baseline + margin``) or breaches an absolute safety ceiling. Before a
  baseline exists it falls back to a fixed absolute threshold. This keeps the
  monitor from misfiring when the embedder or domain shifts the natural scale of
  cosine similarity.

The monitor only *reports*; the skill reacts by raising diversity pressure. This
machinery is never removed or bypassed — it is the whole point.
