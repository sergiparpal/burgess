"""Diverse selection via DPP, plus diversity metrics.

A Determinantal Point Process favours subsets whose items are mutually
dissimilar: the probability of a set is proportional to the determinant of the
kernel submatrix, which is the squared volume they span. We use the standard
**fast greedy MAP** inference (Chen et al., 2018) to pick a diverse slate, with a
farthest-point fallback if anything degenerates.

Metrics here (mean pairwise distance, Vendi score) are used by the variety gate to
prove the diverse slate beats a non-diverse baseline.
