"""Per-session orchestration context.

A :class:`Session` bundles the four things every CLI command needs — the
on-disk :class:`~kg_engine.divergence.state.State` handle, the resolved preference
**domain** (the memory namespace), the axes **spec**, and the **embedder** —
constructed once and resolved lazily.

It exists to hold, in *one* place, the rule the pipeline commands used to each
re-derive by hand: the preference-memory namespace is the ``domain`` of the
persisted axes snapshot. Keeping that here means ``ingest`` / ``recall`` /
``remember`` / ``parents`` can never drift on which namespace a project's
memory lives in.
