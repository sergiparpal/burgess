"""Advisory originality measurement: distance from an "obvious-set".

This module is **measurement only**. Unlike geometric novelty (which has no
external referent — see :mod:`novelty`), originality here is scored against a set
of *obvious* reference vectors (clichés / would-be prior-art anchors): how far an
idea sits from the nearest obvious one.

Hard boundary — load-bearing: originality is **never** wired into the selection
geometry (the DPP ``q`` / kernel in :mod:`diversity`), **never** gates the
self-test (it is excluded from ``ok``), and **never** steers the engine. The skill
uses the same idea at *generation* time (repel clichés); the engine only ever
*measures* it. Keeping it out of selection is what stops a cliché signal from
pruning variety.

Vectors are assumed **L2-normalized** (cosine similarity == dot product),
consistent with every embedder in :mod:`embed`.

    Returns ``{"per_idea": [...], "slate_mean": float}``. Degenerate inputs are
    handled gracefully (no exception, no NaN): an empty ``obvious_vecs`` (no
    referent to be far from) yields ``0.0`` for every idea and a ``0.0`` mean; an
    empty ``idea_vecs`` yields an empty ``per_idea`` and a ``0.0`` mean. A single
