"""Deterministic resolver for the `/kg-build` extraction wave size (orchestration knob, not engine config).

`/kg-build` launches one `kg-extractor` subagent per `##` section, in BOUNDED PARALLEL WAVES whose size
this resolves. It is an ORCHESTRATION parameter consumed by the command/skill, never by `KGEngine` — the
engine reads no env var for it (cf. `tests/test_manifests.py`). The runtime resolution actually happens in
the command's pure-Bash Step 0 (no venv/PYTHONPATH dependency); this module is the authoritative,
unit-tested REFERENCE that the Bash mirrors (the same Python/non-Python mirroring pattern as
`canonmerge.py` ↔ `Canon._merge_into_existing`), and is also runnable as `python -m kg_engine.waves [arg]`
for CI / any python-having caller.

Precedence: explicit inline arg > user_config (the `extract_wave_size` option) > default. A value that
is present but invalid at a given level falls straight to the default (it does NOT cascade to the next
level) — mirroring the Bash `${WAVE_ARG:-$WAVE_CFG}` then validate/clamp. Validation: parse to an
integer; unset / non-numeric / below the minimum → the default; above the maximum → clamp to the maximum.

Where each level comes from at runtime (0.4.5): the inline arg is the wave size the orchestrator parses out
of the command's `$ARGUMENTS` and writes into `WAVE_ARG`; the option is written into `WAVE_CFG` by Claude
Code itself, which fills `${user_config.extract_wave_size}` in the command text when the option is set and
leaves the placeholder (non-numeric, so the default) when it is not. `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_EXTRACT_WAVE_SIZE`
(`WAVE_ENV`) is what hooks and MCP servers receive; Claude Code does not export it to the Bash tool, so the
command no longer reads it, and only this module's CLI does.

    This is the REFERENCE for the command's pure-Bash Step 0, which is what actually runs — so the rules
    here mirror that Bash EXACTLY (the only realistic inputs on which a looser Python would silently drift):

    - **Precedence (Bash `${WAVE_ARG:-$WAVE_CFG}`):** the inline `arg` wins when it is a non-empty
      string — even whitespace-only, which is a *present* value and does NOT cascade to `env` (only a
      truly empty/unset `arg` falls through to `env`, then to `default`).
    - **Validation (Bash `case … in ''|*[!0-9]*`):** the chosen value must be a non-empty run of **ASCII
      digits** — anything with a sign, decimal point, or surrounding/embedded whitespace (`'+5'`, `' 4 '`,
      `'6.5'`) is invalid and resolves to `default` (it does not cascade to the next level).
    - **Clamp:** an all-digit value `< lo` → `default`; `> hi` → `hi`. Always returns an int in `[lo, hi]`.

    (The Bash and this reference agree on every input up to the shell's integer max; an absurd ≥19-digit
    literal is out of scope — Bash cannot clamp past `intmax_t` — and is never a realistic wave size.)
