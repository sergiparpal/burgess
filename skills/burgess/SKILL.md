  Turn a non-self-grounding conceptual document into a grounded, queryable knowledge graph,
  and diverge from any creative brief into a non-cliché slate of ideas. Use this when the
  user wants to build, ground, query, evaluate, or experiment over a knowledge graph
  extracted from prose — anything touching grounding, provenance, spans, falsification,
  bridges/betweenness, the canon-vs-derived split, or "is this claim actually supported by
  the source?" — or wants to brainstorm/ideate/explore an idea space with diversity
  guarantees (/kg-diverge). Triggers: knowledge graph, grounding, provenance, conceptual
  document, build the graph, ground the graph, query the graph, falsification, span-present,
  brainstorm, ideate, diverse ideas, cliché.

# Burgess — operating guide

A conceptual document does not verify itself the way code verifies against a parse tree
(`examples/source.md` §intro). A naive extractor turns such prose into convincing nonsense.
This plugin extracts a graph, then forces every non-trivial edge to earn its place against the
*original text* and against adversarial attack. A deterministic Python engine (`scripts/kg_engine`,
pinned by the ~1000-test suite — the README carries the generated count) does the rule-bound work;
this session and its subagents do the LANGUAGE work and
hand structured JSON back across the MCP boundary. Your job is to orchestrate, not to forge.

## The model: canon vs derived (§1.2)

- **Canon** — the human-editable source of truth. One Markdown file per node at
  `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/canon/<node-id>.md` (YAML frontmatter + body; directed edges live in the
  source node's `edges:` block). The canon carries the grounding state.
- **Derived** — a regenerable, *disposable* projection at
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/derived/{graph.json,index.sqlite}`. The derived layer **contains nothing
  the canon does not**. Never edit it by hand; reproject from canon instead.

## The three axes (§1.3) — orthogonal, never collapsed to one scalar

| axis | values |
| --- | --- |
| `provenance` | `span-present` \| `inferred` \| `hypothesized` |
| `authored_by` | `deterministic` (parser, no LLM) \| `agent` (subagent) \| `human` (only via a verdict) |
| `epistemic_state` | `unverified` \| `grounded` \| `rejected` \| `failed` \| `obsolete` |

A high-provenance edge can still be `unverified`; a `grounded` edge can be `inferred`. Do not
collapse the three into one "quality" number.

## The workflow: build → ground → **generate → ground** → query → eval → experiment

Generation is **offensive**; grounding is the **defensive filter** (the inversion, PLAN §1.2): generation
always emits candidates into a separate `hypothesized` lane, and the *same* grounding loop filters them
afterward. The portico moved from the door of imagination to after generation.

1. **`/kg-build [subset] [wave_size]`** — extract candidate nodes/edges from prose and write them
   through the boundary. Orchestrates **kg-extractor** (one per `##` section, Sonnet by default, launched
   in bounded parallel waves of `wave_size`; emits a `kg_write` payload). Output edges land `unverified`.
2. **`/kg-ground [node_or_query]`** — adjudicate `unverified` **edges AND nodes** (a materialized
   `/kg-diverge` pin is a hypothesized node — often with no incident edge — groundable via
   `kg_ground(kind="node")`; "no edge → can't ground" is false). **kg-grounder** confirms or
   rejects on the merits and stamps verdicts via `kg_ground`; **kg-adversarial-grounder** tries to
   *falsify* surviving edges, recording `attacked_by` edges + `kg_ground(verdict="failed")`.
3. **`/kg-generate [mechanism] [k]`** — turn the graph into an idea generator. `kg_generate` runs the
   deterministic discovery mechanisms (bridge §2/§4, seed §3, compression §7, regroup §8, transplant §5,
   ensemble §9, periphery §5 — low-degree sources) over the derived graph and emits ranked structural
   candidates, each with an advisory `convergence` count (distinct mechanisms agreeing — a grounding-queue
   ranking prior, never a verdict); **kg-generator** phrases &
   names them; they are written `hypothesized`/`unverified` via the propose lane (`kg_propose`/`kg_operate`).
   **`/kg-perturb [second]`** imports external structure and cross-generates against it (§9/§15).
   **Generation never gates on a metric** — the next `/kg-ground` is the filter.
4. **`/kg-query [question]`** — read the grounded graph: `query_graph`, `get_node`,
   `get_neighbors`, `shortest_path`, `kg_explain_path` (the grounded-only associative chain + advisory `leap`),
   and `kg_context` (budgeted, falsification-aware) for grounded answers with provenance. Hypothesized
   candidates appear in a SEPARATE `hypotheses[]` block, never in the grounded `items[]`.
5. **`/kg-eval`** — run the deterministic gates: extraction precision (`f4_probe.py score`, gate
   ≥ 0.70), inter-coder agreement (`harness agreement`, Krippendorff α ≥ 0.67), and the
   bridge-metric gate (`harness specificity`). **kg-annotator** drives these and reports verdicts.
6. **`/kg-experiment`** — control \| graph \| graph+generate \| graph+generate+dpp \| rag ideation
   comparison via `harness ideation`.

The MCP server is named `burgess`; tools are namespaced `mcp__plugin_burgess_burgess__<tool>`.
The sixteen read/write/ground tools (`kg_ping`, `kg_scrub`, `kg_write`, `kg_ground`, `kg_rename`, `kg_merge`,
`kg_metrics`, `kg_status`, `query_graph`, `get_node`, `get_neighbors`, `shortest_path`, `kg_explain_path` — the
read-only grounded-only associative chain, `kg_context`, `kg_agenda` — the read-only structural agenda,
`kg_export` — the read-only human-facing render) plus the four **generative-layer** tools (`kg_propose` — the
hypothesized write lane; `kg_generate` — the discovery mechanisms; `kg_operate` — the §8 endo operations;
`kg_absorption` — the §14 absorption window) make **twenty** graph tools, and the seven
**divergence-surface** tools (`kg_diverge_init`, `kg_diverge_ingest`, `kg_diverge_remember`,
`kg_diverge_parents`, `kg_diverge_metrics`, `kg_diverge_recall`, `kg_diverge_materialize` — the
/kg-diverge flow: MAP-Elites + k-NN novelty + DPP slates + anti-collapse monitor over project-local,
session-ephemeral state under `.kg/diverge/`, plus the EXPLICIT pin-materialization door into the
hypothesized lane; advisory ordering only, below the grounding boundary, never a verdict path) make
**twenty-seven** tools in total. These are the ONLY tools — `kg-build`, `kg-generate`, `kg-diverge`,
etc. are slash commands.

## Core invariants — non-negotiable, enforced by the boundary

1. **span-present (§1.5).** Every non-deterministic edge MUST carry a `span` that is a *verbatim*
   substring of the source (whitespace/case-normalized). No span → `REJECTED/no-supporting-span`;
   span not in source → `REJECTED/span-not-in-source` (fabrication). **Copy spans exactly from the
   source; never paraphrase.** From `source.md`: an edge `generality → attacked_by → specificity`
   needs `span: "a more specific claim, when it holds, defeats a vaguer one"`.
2. **never-forge-a-verdict (§1.4/§1.8).** A `kg_write` payload may NOT assert a non-`unverified`
   `epistemic_state` (`grounded/rejected/failed` *or* `obsolete`), nor claim `authored_by=human` or
   `deterministic` (the latter would otherwise skip span-present — only the in-process parser is
   deterministic). Such payloads are `DEMOTED` to `unverified`/`agent`. Verdicts come ONLY through
   `kg_ground`. The reconciler re-quarantines any out-of-band verdict edit.
3. **generality confound → degree, not betweenness (§1.6).** A vague node accumulates spurious
   edges and spuriously high betweenness because it touches everything loosely. Plain **degree** is
   the honest MVP advisory (`approximates` importance); **specificity-weighted betweenness** is a
   hypothesis, GATED behind `harness specificity` until validated. Grounders MUST reject edges that
   are "true" only because they are generic or unfalsifiable (verdict reason: `vague`).
4. **memory of failures (§1.7).** `rejected`/`failed` edges are NEGATIVE INFORMATION — never
   pruned, surfaced in `kg_context.falsification_counters.failed_or_rejected_edges`. The
   adversarial grounder *creates* this signal via `attacked_by` edges plus
   `kg_ground(verdict="failed")`. A graph that forgets its mistakes drifts into nonsense.
5. **egress scrub (§1.9).** `mcp__plugin_burgess_burgess__kg_scrub(text)` redacts secrets (always) plus
   PII (per `sensitivity`) with CONSISTENT placeholders (`⟦SECRET:1⟧` etc.) *before* text is handed
   to a subagent; `kg_write` then RESTORES placeholder spans to the ORIGINAL text so the canon
   stores the restored original span. On the no-PII demo source it is a no-op (0 redactions).

## Boundary dispositions (what `kg_write` returns)

`ACCEPTED` (written, `unverified`) · `DEMOTED` (written, one axis downgraded) ·
`QUARANTINED` (structurally valid but untrusted, e.g. undeclared type) · `REJECTED` (not written).
`retryable=false` for SEMANTIC rejections (no-span, span-not-in-source, vague); `retryable=true`
for TRANSPORT failures (truncation, schema). A `kg_write` payload may set `"complete": true` (it defaults to `true` for a single-shot write); only an explicit `"complete": false` is `REJECTED` as truncated (a streaming producer sets it on a non-final chunk).

## Domain pack

`pack/pack.yaml` declares the vocabulary. Types outside it → `QUARANTINED/undeclared-node-type` (nodes) or
`QUARANTINED/undeclared-edge-type` (edges).
- node types: `compression`, `primitive`, `claim`, `metric`, `operation`, `failure`
- edge types: `grounds`, `attacked_by`, `reconciles_with`, `bridges`, `collapses_into`,
  `confounded_by`, `approximates`, `defends_against`, `projects`, `survives`

Use only these in extraction. Glossary and per-term specificity seeds live in `pack/pack.yaml` +
`pack/glossary.md`. Validate coverage with `python -m kg_engine.pack validate pack/pack.yaml examples/source.md`.

## References (load on demand)

Keep this guide tight; full detail lives in `references/` and is read only when needed:
- `contract.md` — the canon note frontmatter + `edges:` schema, the full `kg_write` payload
  contract, and the boundary disposition decision table with reason strings,
- `tools.md` — every MCP tool's signature and return shape, plus the deterministic CLI
  cheatsheet (`f4_probe.py`, `kg_engine.pack`, `kg_engine.harness`) and the F4-probe label
  vocabulary (`correct | fabricated | vague | wrong_type`, `span_found: y|n`) with the eval
  gate thresholds,
- `pack-schema.md` — the domain-pack schema (`pack/pack.yaml`), coverage check, and
  specificity seeds,
- `operators.md`, `judge_rubric.md`, `axis_inference.md` — the divergence-side language work:
  variation operators, the validity-only judge rubric, and how to infer descriptor axes from
  a brief (`/kg-diverge`). `/kg-diverge` also takes a **reach** dial
  (`conservative|balanced|wild`, default `balanced`) that tempers divergence in *degree* —
  `boldness` band, `feasibility` lean, operator mix — while leaving divergence in *kind* (the
  `mechanism` axis) maximal; coherence is enforced at every reach.

The authoritative data model is the engine source under `scripts/kg_engine` (start at `model.py`
and `boundary.py`). When in doubt about a field or symbol, grep the engine rather than guessing.
